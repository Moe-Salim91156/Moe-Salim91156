# üëã Hello, My Name is Mohammad Salim!

I'm a passionate **Software Engineering Graduate** with a knack for Automation, low-level programming, DevOps, and game development. I enjoy crafting efficient solutions, automating workflows, and exploring the intersection of art and technology. Currently, I'm focused on building my 42 projects, as part of my journey at [42 Amman](https://42network.org/).
